Following this, you will be asked to complete an optional demographic survey. Participation in this research is voluntary, and you are free to withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
            <h3>TIME INVOLVEMENT</h3> 
            <p>Your participation will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

            <h3>PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY</h3> 
            <p>The risks associated with this study are minimal. This judgment is based on a large body of experience with the same or similar procedures with people of similar ages, sex, origins, etc. Study data will be stored securely, in compliance with Stanford University standards, minimizing the risk of confidentiality breach. Your individual privacy will be maintained during the research and in all published and written data resulting from the study.</p>
